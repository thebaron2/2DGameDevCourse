  storyText: "You quickly set foot on the floor below and just as you do that something
    big hits the ship and you barely manage to keep standing. Suddenly you hear some
    people talking and you quickly take cover behind some crates. One of them says
    \"Hey guys, I just got word from the captain that two pirate ships are attacking
    us and that we might be boarded soon, so keep an eye out for that scum.\"\r\nYou
    carefully look over the crates and you see three guards guarding a big crate.
    All three are heavily armed.\r\n\r\nYou could try to talk to them, but they are
    just as likely to see you as a pirate. You could also keep listening, but that
    would make you look even more suspicious when they find you.\r\n\r\nWhat do you
    do?\r\n1. Approach them.\r\n2. Keep listening."
