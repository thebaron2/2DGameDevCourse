  storyText: "As the elevator doors open you are immediately greeted with guns aimed
    at your head. Someone asks you who you are and what you are doing here, but before
    you can answer a boarding ship hits the bridge.\r\nThe guards quickly turn around
    to face this new threat.\r\n\r\nYou could either try to take the gun of the one
    closest to you or try to run for the escape pods.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1.
    Take the gun from the guy closest to you.\r\n2. Run to the escape pods."
