    out the window and realize that you are on spaceship going through an asteroid
    field and what looks like multiple ships following.\r\n\r\nAs you realize this
    an alarm starts to go off, you are thinking one of the asteroids must have hit

    going on.\r\n\r\nIn which direction do you go?\r\n1. Go right, towards an elevator.\r\n2.
